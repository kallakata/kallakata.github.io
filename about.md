Hi! I am **kallakata**.

This site serves as a mere hotpot of ideas, scribbled notes, interesting observations and other career and tech-related stuff. Nowadays, I mostly focus on Platform Engineering topics, Linux administration, DevOps-y concepts and some programming, especially in Go and Rust, to make my day-to-day life easier.
